# Stay at Home Choir Dev Site

The development website for the Stay at Home Choir project.

## Getting Started

`docker-compose up -d` to build and run the Docker container described in the docker-compose.yml file.

There is a binding to the wp-content directory so edits you make to the theme will be picked up while the container is running.
